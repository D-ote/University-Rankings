# University Rankings (2016 - 2024)

### Project Objective
The objective of this dataset analysis is to explore and understand the factors influencing the rankings of universities worldwide. By examining various attributes such as overall score, teaching quality, research environment, industry impact, and international outlook, we aim to uncover insights into the characteristics that contribute to a university's standing in the global academic landscape. Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization techniques, we seek to identify patterns, trends, and correlations among the different factors and rankings. 

Ultimately, the goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that drive university rankings and provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the education sector, policymakers, and academic institutions seeking to enhance their performance and global competitiveness.
